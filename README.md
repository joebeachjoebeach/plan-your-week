**Plan Your Week** is a time management desktop web-app that helps you budget your time to get things done.

I modeled this app after my method of time management: 
- At the beginning of each week, I make a list of the things I want or need to get done that week.
- For each thing on my list, I make an estimate of how long it'll take. 
- For each day of the week, I determine how much time I can commit to getting things done.
- I make a separate mini-list for each day, adding items from the master list according to the budgeted time.

This step-by-step approach has been remarkably effective for me, and I've found it missing from popular to-do list apps. So, that's why I decided to make Plan Your Week.

## Features
- Make a master to-do list for your week
- Budget your time for each task and each day
- Break your master list up into smaller, more manageable chunks for each day.
